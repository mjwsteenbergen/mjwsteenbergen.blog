# mjwsteenbergen.blog

This is the code that runs my blog. The blog posts are pulled from [Atlas](https://blog.nntn.nl/architecture-of-my-life), who gets it from my [Notion databases](https://www.notion.so/), which contains the data of all of the blogposts. It is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which uses server-side rendering, enabling me to use a component based structure, but relase static webpages.
